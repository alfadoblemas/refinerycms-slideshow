This a RefineryCMS plugin for managing slideshows in the backend. It's intended to include some kind of helper + JS code so we can have a slideshow without having to write again the HTML, but for now thatÅ› just a dream.

Installing
==========

In Gemfile `gem "refinerycms-slideshow", "~> 2.0.10.0"`

Current status
==============

The plugin right now includes a backend that allow us to create a slideshow and attach it slides with images, videos and an html body.

To Do
=====

* Attach a slideshow to an object: "This product must have an slideshow", "I want an slideshow in this refinery page"... Imagine if we just can reuse the slideshow admin!

* Some default front helpers: This way we could have a slideshow running without any extra front effort
